# Predict Natural Disasters
use RaspberryPi & SenseHat to measure the readings of Temperature, Humidity and pressure etc.,
use Machine Learning algorithms to predict the natural disasters based on previous data with the collection of all the natural disasters occurred till now.
get a threshold value in which there is a chance of occurring the same event again.
implement that threshold values in our SenseHat saying if the parameters exceeds this particular values then send a notification saying the chances of occurring natural disaster.
if we place the sensors in certain locations which is most affected in the past, it tells us the indicating parameters and using ML Algorithms we can easily predict whether the event ia going to occur or not.
further we can send notifications through emails or app to get attention of the civilians so that they can protect themselves by taking certain measures
